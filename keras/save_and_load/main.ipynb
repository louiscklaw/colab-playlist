    "There are different ways to save TensorFlow models depending on the API you're using. This guide uses [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)—a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow. The new, high-level `.keras` format used in this tutorial is recommended for saving Keras objects, as it provides robust, efficient name-based saving that is often easier to debug than low-level or legacy formats. For more advanced saving or serialization workflows, especially those involving custom objects, please refer to the [Save and load Keras models guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize). For other approaches, refer to the [Using the SavedModel format guide](../../guide/saved_model.ipynb)."

    "\n",
    "If you are using the SavedModel format, you can skip this section. The key difference between high-level `.keras`/HDF5 formats and the low-level SavedModel format is that the `.keras`/HDF5 formats uses object configs to save the model architecture, while SavedModel saves the execution graph. Thus, SavedModels are able to save custom objects like subclassed models and custom layers without requiring the original code. However, debugging low-level SavedModels can be more difficult as a result, and the recommended approach is using the high-level `.keras` format instead due to its name-based, Keras built-in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save custom objects to `.keras` and HDF5, you must do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a `get_config` method in your object, and optionally a `from_config` classmethod.\n",
    "  * `get_config(self)` returns a JSON-serializable dictionary of parameters needed to recreate the object.\n",
    "  * `from_config(cls, config)` uses the returned config from `get_config` to create a new object. By default, this function will use the config as initialization kwargs (`return cls(**config)`).\n",
    "2. Pass the custom objects to the model in one of three ways:\n",
    "  - Register the custom object with the `@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable` decorator. **(recommended)**\n",
    "  - Directly pass the object to the `custom_objects` argument when loading the model. The argument must be a dictionary mapping the string class name to the Python class. E.g., `tf.keras.models.load_model(path, custom_objects={'CustomLayer': CustomLayer})`\n",
    "  - Use a `tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope` with the object included in the `custom_objects` dictionary argument, and place a `tf.keras.models.load_model(path)` call within the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Writing layers and models from scratch](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models) tutorial for examples of custom objects and `get_config`.\n"
